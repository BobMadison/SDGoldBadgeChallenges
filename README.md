# SDGoldBadgeChallenges
I did challenges 1, 2, and 4. I started 3 but decided to go for 4. So, please ignore the directories with the Badges.

This is Challenge #1 the Komodo Cafe. There is a menu to do 1 of 6 things.

Enter the numbner of the option you'd like to select:
1. Show the Menu
2. Find a menu item by name of meal
3. Find a menu item by number of meal
4. Add a new menu item
5. Remove a meal
6. Update a meal
0. Exit

I did the second challenge. The menu for the second challenge is
1. Show all Claims
2. Take care of the next claim
3. Add a new claim

I did the fourth challenge. The menu for the 4th challenge is
1. Show all Events
2. Show Golf Outing Totals
3. Show Bowling Outing Totals
4. Show Amusement Park Totals
5. Show Concert Totals
6. Add an Event

I didn't do any error checking. On Challenge #1, I did quite a bit more than was required.

This was a great assignment. Even though I have a lot of programming experience, I learned a great deal.
